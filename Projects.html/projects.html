                <p>In 2012, I went on an overseas CIP trip with my CCA: Boys' Brigade. We flew over as a combined team
                    from the Boys' and Girls' Brigade and helped refurbish a library in an Orphanage. The entire trip
                    lasted 5 days, with the first 4 days spent painting and spending time with the children at the
                    orphanage. A brief summary of the trip can be seen in the table below.</p>

                <p>When we first arrived, the paint was peeling off the walls and the room was extremely dusty and
                    dirty, with many cobwebs and dead insects lying around. We then thoroughly swept the room and
                    removed the cobwebs before moving all the furniture such as tables, chairs and shelves out of the
                    room to prepare the room for painting. Once the room had been cleared, we used paint scrappers to
                    scrape the paint off the walls and sanded the wall with sandpaper to smoothen them. After that, we
                    washed the walls to ensure they would be clean for the fresh coat of paint.</p>

                <p>As the orphanage was in a rural part of the country, there was no steady water supply. The children
                    in the orphanage got their water by drawing from a well using a pump. To get water to wash the
                    walls, we had to use the pump to draw water from the well. Drawing water from the pump was a tiring
                    process as it required quick and constant pumping of the lever to get a steady flow of water going.
                    The lever was a cylindrical piece of wood loosely slotted into the pump, which made it harder to
                    pump as the wood piece would frequently get dislodged by the pumping motion and had to be
                    reinserted. Although it was difficult the first few times, we slowly got the hang of it and were
                    able to draw water quickly.</p>

        <div class="row projPara4">
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>The next day, we painted an undercoat of paint primer before painting the actual coat of paint on the
                    walls. This process took an entire day as we had to let the undercoat dry completely before applying
                    the main coat. Once the main layer of paint had dried, we moved all the furniture back into the
                    room. We then gave the books that people had donated to us back in Singapore to the orphanage and
                    helped organize all the books in the mini library. Once everything had been moved back, we checked
                    the room to ensure everything was in order before opening it to the children, who were eager to see
                    how their re-furbished library would look like.</p>

        <div class="row projPara5">
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>After we had completed the whole process of re-furbishing their library, we had one more day left at
                    the orphanage which we spent interacting with the children there. We played soccer, volleyball and
                    various hand games they taught us and talked to find out more about each other. The children there
                    taught us how to make small ‘toy-origami’ using long blades of grass which grew all around the
                    orphanage, which we all took great interest in to the amusement of the children there. At the end of
                    the day, we bade farewell to the children and gave them some school supplies that they could use in
                    the future as a parting gift.</p>

                <p>This overseas CIP trip was an eye-opener for me as I was exposed to the culture of a foreign land for
                    the first time and I was able to have hands-on experience in helping a local community in another
                    country. I learnt to appreciate what I had in Singapore compared to what the children in the
                    orphanage had in Cambodia and not take things for granted here. This trip also sparked my interest
                    in helping others, which led to me embarking on another similar overseas CIP trip in 2013.</p>
