                <p>I was a student at Bukit Batok Secondary School (BBSS) from the year 2011-2014. My PSLE results
                    allowed me to enter the express stream and from Secondary 1-2, I studied the same base subjects as
                    my fellow peers: English, Mother Tongue, Science (Physics/ Chemistry), Pure Humanities
                    (Geography/History), Literature, Art, Home Economics and Design and Technology. Along with these
                    base subjects, I took on Malay as my third Mother Tongue under the Malay Special Program (MSP) from
                    Secondary 1 till Secondary 4. I performed well in my first 2 years in BBSS and was given the choice
                    to enter either the Arts or Science stream, along with which subjects I wanted to study in Secondary
                    3 and 4 when it came time for subject streaming at the end of Secondary 2. </p>

                <p>I entered the Science Stream in Secondary 3 and 4 and took on 9 subjects: English, Mother Tongue
                    (Chinese), MSP (Malay), Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Additional Math, Elementary Math, Combined
                    Humanities (Elective Geography and Social Studies). I chose to study 3 Pure Sciences in Secondary 3
                    and 4 because of my interest in Science, despite being told that it would be a challenge due to how
                    content heavy it would be. Due to the updated facilities of my Secondary School, I was able to
                    perform many practical science experiments that I never had the opportunity to do so before, which
                    further nurtured my interest in Science and allowed me to excel. I performed well throughout my last
                    2 years in BBSS and was able to attain an ‘O’-level score of 10.</p>

                <p>While I was in BBSS, I joined BB as my CCA due to my interest in the Uniformed Group. I participated
                    actively in my CCA throughout my 4 years in BBSS, going for numerous competitions such as a drill
                    competition and the ‘CharacterQuest’ competitions. I also participated in 2 overseas CIP trips to
                    Cambodia, where a team of students and teachers from the Boys’ Brigade and Girls’ Brigade companies
                    in BBSS flew over and carried out various projects such as refurbishing a library in an orphanage
                    and teaching English to the local students.</p>
                <p><br>In my time studying at BBSS, I learnt valuable lessons in leadership through my experiences in my
                    CCA: Boys’ Brigade and was able to nurture my interest in Science with the help of the many teachers
                    who taught me. This eventually led me to discover my interest in Computer Science and the decision
                    to pursue my current course in Singapore Polytechnic now.</p>
